             <p>While pounding the chicken breast thin and searing is a French technique, the flavor profile here is decidedly Spanish.</p>
             <p>Serves 4 (serving size: 1 chicken breast half and about 1 tablespoon almond mixture)</p>
             <p>Preparation</p>
                 <oL class="menu-body">
                     <li>Heat a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons oil; swirl. Add 2 chicken breast halves; cook 3 minutes on each side or until done. Remove from pan. Repeat procedure with 1 1/2 teaspoons oil and remaining 2 chicken breast halves.
                     </li> 
                     <li> Reduce heat to medium. Add stock, scraping pan to loosen browned bits. Stir in remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Add garlic; saute 1 minute. Add remaining 1/8 teaspoon salt, almonds, and next 5 ingredients (through Dijon); cook 1 minute or until heated, stirring occasionally. Spoon almond mixture over chicken. Sprinkle with parsley and olives.
                     Fast Skillet Chicken Cacciatore
                     Lean chicken breasts cook quickly--in just 15 minutes compared to the hour-long braise in most cacciatore recipes. If you'd like more heat in the sauce, kick up the crushed red pepper to 1/2 teaspoon. </li>
